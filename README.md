# ReplaceBlocksMod

A utility mod that lets you replace blocks with other blocks, used entirely
through the console.

The provided commands are intended to be more convenient than using the
vanilla `/fill` command.

## Commands

### 1. `/replace <sourceBlock> with <targetBlock>`

Replaces all nearby instances of `sourceBlock` with `targetBlock`.

e.g. `/replace oak_planks with cherry_planks`

***

### 2. `/removegrass`

Removes all nearby short grass and long grass.
Regular grass blocks will not be removed.
